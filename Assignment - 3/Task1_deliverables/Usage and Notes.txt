Before using the commands it the containing folder should be as follows -
	doc_vectors/
	alldocs/
	vectorize.py
	update_query.py
	output.txt
	query.txt

First we run the following command in the alldocs folder
	perl -pi -e 's/\n/ /g' *
	perl -pi -e 's/\r/ /g' *
Then run 	
	python vectorize.py	//it produces query vectors in query_vectors.txt and query documents for each document in doc_vectors/
	python update_query.py	//it takes the query and document vectors and expands the query and keeps it in updated_query.txt
