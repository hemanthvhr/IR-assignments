But when his comments were circulated in upstate communities
last month, local officials called them a ``sneak attack'' on the
rights of residents around the reservoirs to develop their
property A study commissioned by a group of landowners and developers and
the National Association of Counties estimated the cost to the
economy of the new permitting process at $300 million a year William Stasiuk, a
deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental
Protection in charge of the water supply, recommended that the
strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the
2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual
applications required for any filling or construction affecting
more than one-third of an acre of wetlands The accusations by Neil came about three weeks after the state
and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that they were
close to approving conditions under which growers could expand into
300 acres of wetlands over the next five years without seeking
specific permission for each expansion as they had in the past The combination could go a long way to removing much of the
pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the
Salton Sea, the largest lake in California For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the
border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the
surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes
and throat after a few minutes of exposure Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have

100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help
prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for
endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food
chain
