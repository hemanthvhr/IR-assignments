But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will
have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were
relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former
security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has
prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values
and customs That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes
over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida
to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be
exempt from state regulation and taxation ``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino
and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member
of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe But opponents of the measure, including the California Labor
Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers, complain that it
would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker
health and safety laws, and calls for distributing a maximum of 2
percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling
machines to non-gaming tribes So Proposition 5 leaves
little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact
allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted
them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow
games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money,
not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City
