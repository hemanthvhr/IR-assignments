The study represents a new wave in academic medicine: the
application of rigorous, Western scientific methods _ including the
gold standard of medical research, the placebo, or fake therapy, as
a control _ to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo biloba to
shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known as qi gong It involves a
genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes
inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage
and bone ``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year
getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch
Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy
at Baylor, who helped design the study ``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of
arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat
people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the
side effects,'' says Rubin ``We know from the (medical) literature on the placebo effect
that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is
greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said Researchers studied X-rays of the
subjects' knees and tried to correlate the degree of their disease
with the components of vitamin E in the blood The researchers chose the pomegranate for study because it has a
long history of use as a folk medicine in the Middle East, Iran and
India Make way for the latest entrant to the pantheon of fruits and
vegetables that may fight disease: the pomegranate
